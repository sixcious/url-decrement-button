## Important
I want you to be 100% happy with URL Decrement Button! If something isn't working right, or if there's a feature you think is missing, [please open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/sixcious/url-decrement-button/issues) and give me a chance to help before leaving a review.

## About
URL Decrement Button is a simple 1-Click Button that can decrement a URL for you. The button will try to decrement the most likely number in the URL using its built-in algorithm (this is usually the last number). If it's not picking the right number you want, you can install and use "URL Incrementer" (separately available) to select the part of the URL you want to decrement. The button will then decrement the part you selected in URL Incrementer.

## Features
- Decrements the URL (finds a number in the URL and then decrements it by 1)
- A simple 1-Click Decrement Button with no configuration or settings
- Works with URL Incrementer (separately available) so you can use its settings to decrement if needed
- Requires no permissions
- Uses no background memory when not in use

## Permissions Justification
No permissions are needed.
